\section{Mission Statement}
To create the fastest and most cost efficient cluster of single-board computers and investigate alternative communication modes. CNS  

\section{Elevator Pitch}

Our goal is to build a cluster of single-board computers that produces as many Floating Point Operations possible per Watt per dollar. We are testing three computers, ODROID, Raspberry Pi, and PcDuino, to determine the best for the cluster. Once we have the cluster, we will investigate alternative communication modes. CNS
