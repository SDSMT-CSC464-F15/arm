\subsection*{Overview}
During this sprint, our team first decided to use the ODROID devices instead of Raspberry PIs based on our findings from sprint one. We roughly planned out our budget for ethernet cables, the switch, varius USB cables, power strips, and the devices themselves and extra memory for them. At this stage, we did not chose exactly what we would buy, but we narrowed our budget enough to know that the number of devices we could have without going over the limit set by our sponser was eight. Dr. Karlsson then ordered seven more ODroids, an eight port switch, eight ethernet cables, and one USB to RJ45 device to benchmark USB to ethernet speeds. We encountered an issue where the order was backordered, and we did not receive the devices until over two weeks laters. Once we did get them, we benchmarked the speed over ethernet between two devices through the switch, and the speed when one device was using a USB to RJ45 to connect to the switch. We also attempted to benchmark the direct connection between RJ45 on one device connected directly to the ethernet of another device, but found that we would need a crossover cable. We concluded our sprint by setting up all eight devices by installing MPI and giving them static IP addresses on the network over the switch. \newline \newline Dr. Karlsson as been informed of a research synposium and has suggested our team take part of it. We are adding this to our goals for Senior Design to take part in that.
