\section{Sprint Report \#1}

\subsection*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mission Statement
	\item User Stories
	\item Number Generating Code
	\item Benchmark Code
	\item Benchmark Log
	\item Signed Software Contract
	\item Updated Design Document
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Work for this sprint included:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wrote Mission Statement and Elevator Speech
	\item Drew up Software Contract
	\item Wrote user stories
	\item Obtained ODroid 4xU, Raspberry Pi 2B, and PcDuino 8 single-board computers
	\item Wrote number generating code
	\item Wrote benchmark code that ran addition, multiplication, division, and sine floating point operations
	\item Added OpenMP to run the benchmark code on all cores
	\item Ran the code each of the single-board computers
	\item Logged times
	\item Calculated the GFlops
	\item Calculated the GFlops/Dollar/Watts
	\item Determined best computer
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Work that is carried over into Sprint 2 is as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Using the benchmark results to determine which computer to use
	\item Order more of the computers that proved best from Sprint 1 and maintain the given budget of \$1,200
	\item Find a topology that best fits the cluster
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Decide on a computer based on the results of the benchmarking
	\item Calculate prices on supplies and computers while maintaining below the budget
	\item Ordering said supplies and computers
	\item Build the cluster to perform floating-point operations
	\item Benchmark the cluster
	\item Experiment with different connections
	\item Create a new mode of communication
\end{itemize}

\section{Sprint Report \#2}
The sprint reports should be inserted here.     Reports focus on process.  Design elements can be inserted into the design chapter with the report discussing the design element in more of an overview fashion.
