	Over the course of completing this project, we used various tests to gather benchmark results in order to determine the clustering method that best matched our criteria. We first benchmarked each device individually that was availible to us to decide which to use for our cluster.

	The first benchmark we ran was a simple test of how many gigaflops the Raspberry Pi 2B and ODROID-XU4 were capable of. We wrote a benchmark that created a matrix of random floating point values and ran four calculations across all of the numbers, addition, multiplication, division, and sine. Since our goal was to determine the device that produced the most amount of gigaflops per dollar per watt, we also measured the amount of watts of power used by each device while running these calculations. We found that the Raspberry Pi 2B and ODROID-XU4 were extrememly close in performance due to the Pi being roughly half as expensive and using a quarter of the power, but the ODROID being roughly eight times faster. In the end, the fact that the ODroid had two USB 3.0 ports allowing us more options if how to cluster the devices drove our decision to build our cluster out of ODROIDs.
	We then implemented the High-Performance Linpack benchmark in order to use a standard benchmarking method. After installing HPL, we ran it first on a single ODROID-XU4 using all eight cores. In order to get results that were as accurate as possible, HPL was configured to create a matrix that filled almost all of the free memory in order to maximize the amount of calculations done without having to use the swap space. It was found that each device was capable of roughly 3.15 gigaflops.
	The next step was to cluter the eight devices. First, a switch was used connected to the 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports on the ODROIDS. Iperf was used to test the data transfer speed of the Ethernet connections, and found to be roughly 750Mbps. The clustered the eight ODROIDs were then all used to run HPL. The maximum amount of gigaflops recorded was 10.48 using all 64 cores and HPL re-configured to use all the free memory of all eight of the devices.
	With that result in mind, the goal was then to test different clustering methods to try and find a way to produce more gigaflops. First GPIO connections were analyzed. Using WiringPi to read from and write to the pins was successful in transmitting data. To test the speed, we wrote a short program to send a 64 bit integer value from one ODROID to annother over a single pin 10,000 times. It was found that even without a delay or waiting for the receiving device to signal that it read the pin, the C code with WiringPi was only able to send about 500,000 bits per second, or 0.5Mbps. This means that even using all 42 pins, any communication protocol that could be made would be several orders of magnitude slower than the 750Mbps that Ethernet was found to be.
