Linpack:

	In order to benchmark our cluster, we used High-Performance Linpack. To build HPL, we first downloaded and built the Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, ATLAS, as well as the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, BLAS. One of those would be needed to be linked to build HPL, and we intended to use both and see which gave higher performance. However, BLAS did not build correctly with HPL, and was abandonned. Instead we created a makefile for HPL to include the correct MPI and ATLAS libraries and built the software. HPL includes a configuration file to allow the user to set the matrix size, block size and process grid dimensions. The file was edited such that the matrix size was large enough to use as much memory as possible without requiring swap space to be used. Due to the memory needs of the kernel, this was approximately 1,600 MB per ODROID. The block size and grid dimensions were found to be most effective at 128 and 2x4 through experimentation.
