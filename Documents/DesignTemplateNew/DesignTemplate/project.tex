%%team, project, environment, etc. 



\section{Team Member's Roles}
%Describe who was involved and what role(s) were played.

	\item Andrew Hoover - hardware/testing/software 
	\item Christine Sorensen - team lead/parallel programmer/software/documentation
\end{itemize}

\section{Project  Management Approach}
Project will be split into six sprints, each lasting two weeks. Items from the backlog are organized and assigned into these sprints. \newline \newline Product backlog is located on the Trello board. Documents and source code is located on Github. \newline \newline Formal meetings take place twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1:00pm in advisor's, Dr. C. Karlsson's, office. Casual meetings are planned as needed.

%%etc.? 

All members for the project will be responsible for a variety of roles. Aside from Christine Sorensen being the Scrum Master, the members of the team will share the workload.

\section{Budget}
%%Describe the budget for the project including gifted equipment and salaries for 
%%people on the project.

The total budget for this project is \$1,200. This includes all spending that will need to be done for the project. 

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
%%Describe the IP ownership and issues surrounding IP.

All IP for the project will be owned by the school.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
%%If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
%%implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
%%This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
%%and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
%%revision. 

%%All of the Agile decisions are listed here.  For example, how do you order your backlog?   
%%Did you use planning poker?

The project work will be divided in to Sprints with set backlogs. Each Sprint will contain it's own set of goals and results. The backlog will be ordered according to what the Product Owner Dr. Chirster Karlssson dictates. 

\section{Terminology and Acronyms}
%%*Provide a list of terms used in the document that warrant definition.  Consider 
%%industry or domain specific terms and acronyms as well as system specific. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Benchmarking - running tests in order to assess the perfomance of the computers
	\item iperf - tool in standard Debian repositories to test network speed
\end{itemize}

\section{Sprint Schedule}
%%The sprint schedule.  Can be tables or graphs.   This can be a list of dates with the visual 
%%representation given below.

Sprint 1: 9/14/15 - 10/2/15 \\
Sprint 2: 10/12/15 - 10/30/15 \\

\section{Source  Control}
%%Which source control system is/was used?  How was it setup?  How does a developer 
%%connect to it? 

Github will be used for our source control. Our repository was created by Dr. Jeff McGough for our use during the project. The repo is set to be public, so everyone has read access. Both team members, Dr. McGough and the Product Owner Dr. Christer Karlsson have write access.

\section{Build  Environment}
%%How are the packages built?  Are there build scripts?
