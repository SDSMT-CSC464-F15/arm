\section{Mission Statement}
To create the fastest and most cost effcient cluster of single-board computers.

\section{Elevator Pitch}
Our goal is to build a cluster of single-board computers that produces as many floating-point operations possible per watt per dollar. We are testing three computers:  ODROID, Raspberry Pi, and PcDuino and finding alternative modes of communication outside of the traditional ethernet port in order to find what best fits our cluster.
