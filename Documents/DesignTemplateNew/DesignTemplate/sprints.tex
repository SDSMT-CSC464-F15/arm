\subsection*{Overview}
During this sprint, our team first decided to use the ODROID devices instead of Raspberry PIs based on our findings from sprint one. We roughly planned out our budget for ethernet cables, the switch, varius USB cables, power strips, and the devices themselves and extra memory for them. At this stage, we did not chose exactly what we would buy, but we narrowed our budget enough to know that the number of devices we could have without going over the limit set by our sponser was eight. Dr. Karlsson then ordered seven more ODroids, an eight port switch, eight ethernet cables, and one USB to RJ45 device to benchmark USB to ethernet speeds. We encountered an issue where the order was backordered, and we did not receive the devices until over two weeks laters. Once we did get them, we benchmarked the speed over ethernet between two devices through the switch, and the speed when one device was using a USB to RJ45 to connect to the switch. We also attempted to benchmark the direct connection between RJ45 on one device connected directly to the ethernet of another device, but found that we would need a crossover cable. We concluded our sprint by setting up all eight devices by installing MPI and giving them static IP addresses on the network over the switch. \newline \newline Dr. Karlsson as been informed of a research synposium and has suggested our team take part of it. We are adding this to our goals for Senior Design to take part in that.

\section{Sprint Report \#3}

\subsection*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built cluster
	\item MPI code
	\item Mounted home directory
	\item Shutdown script
	\item Mounting script
	\item LINPACK and ATLAS installed on ODROIDs
	\item MPI installed on ODROIDs
	\item Hostnames
	\item Fixed IP Addresses
	\item SSH configuration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built cluster
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All parts for the cluster were ordered. Parts included:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 8 ODROID XU4's
			\item Switch
			\item Power box
			\item Ethernet cables
			\item Acrylic board
			\item Accessories, such as handles and power switches
		\end{itemize}
		\item The ODROIDs, switch and power box were mounted onto the acrylic board. ODROIDs were connected to the switch and the power box.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Set up cluster
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fixed IP addresses to each ODROID
		\item Assigned a hostname to each ODROID
		\item Configured cluster network
		\item NFS share
		\item Configured sudo
		\item Set-up ssh between ODROIDS
	\end{itemize}
	\item Benchmarked cluster
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Installed LINPACK
		\item Wrote MPI code to run on the cluster
		\item Ran the MPI code with LINPACK on the cluster
		\item Gathered data
	\end{itemize}
	\item Setbacks
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Backorder
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The remaining ODROIDs were backordered, delaying to assembling of the cluster.
		\end{itemize}	
		\item Broken ODROIDs
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Two of the ODROIDs needed to be replaced. It was believed that the two ODROIDs were placed on the power supply without covering which exposed the soldering on the bottom to sepatate it from the metal which might have crossed circuits causing the ODROIDs to not power up. Ordering the new ODROIDs put us behind in our timeline.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Installing LINPACK
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The installation of LINPACK was complicated and prompted issues. It took longer than expected to complete.
		\end{itemize}
