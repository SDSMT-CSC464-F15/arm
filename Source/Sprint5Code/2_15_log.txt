Working on communicating between dwarfs in cluster via network.


***
Originally was wokring on communicating in a 8 node ring, however, we decided to just
jump right into working on a hypercube.
All connected via GreyCode.

***
Was thinking maybe do an XOR and compare bit to tell which dwarf to go where 
next.

Or, this could be use to calculate the shortest distance, include that as a header
for the packet, and send it on its wayward son.

***
New idea however, what about creating a text file in each ODROID that will tell how
to get to each ODROID, for example...

Hypothetical connection: 

Doc - Grumpy - Sneezy - Sleepy 
|                             \
Dopey - SnowWhite - Bashful - Happy

Say you want to go from Grumpy  to Happy. A text file in Group would say:

Doc - Doc
Dopey - Doc
SnowWhite - Doc
Bashful - Sneezy
Happy - Sneezy
Sleepy - Sneezy
Sneezy - Sneezy

NOTE: Default is going clockwise. Happy from Doc can be achieved both was in the 
    shortest path via Dopey and Grumpy, but it'll say Grumpy.

In the text file, you would find "Happy", and next to it, it tells you to go to
"Sneezy". It will then go to Sneezy. In its text file, you'll look for "Happy" and
it'll tell you to go to "Sleepy" and so on an so fourth from now until ever amen.
