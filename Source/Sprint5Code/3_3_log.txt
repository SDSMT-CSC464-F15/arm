Trying to run LINPACK on all of the dwarfs.
We currently have them hooked up in a loop.
Last time, Andrew was having troubles running it on row 1 of dwarfs
	that were connected in a loop.

Snow White lost MPI somehow???
Now LINPACK isn't working.

When LINPACK runs, it shows no output. However, the dwarfs continue to spin.

In the meantime, we're going to Bashful. Our latest issue was that it won't
	show on the screen. It's just a black screen but it shows the mouse.
	I.E. Bashful is living up to its name. It's being bashful.
	It really only does that if it falls asleep.
	We took care of that. Bashful won't sleep anymore. Mwahahaha.

Had to change the ip addresses on bashful again. We have to update some of
	the ip addresses on the odroids. This is a bitch and a half.
