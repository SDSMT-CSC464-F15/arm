Starting to create the hypercube. Had some difficulties pinging other dwarfs via
ping to the new ethernet. They are now working.
See creatingNetThreeEth.txt

Sleepy is showing just a black screen. It still has the mouse, but just a black
screen. Come on man, you can do it!

Trying to update routing table so that things work pretty much so each dwarf
knows what port to use to connect to each dwarf.
