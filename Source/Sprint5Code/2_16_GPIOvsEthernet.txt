The ODroid XU4 UART has a default baud rate of 115200, and maximum of 921600(1). 
This means that the maximum possible data transer speed is 0.88Mpbs (921600/1024^2). 
This is drastically slower than Ethernet communication, which we benchmarked at a minimum of 750 Mpbs. 
In fact, in order to make a protocol faster than Ethernet, even if we used all 40 pins to tranfer data, 
	we would need each pin to send over 19.5 million bits per second ( (750 * 1024^2) / 40 ). 
WiringPi, in our preliminary testing, was only able to send about 500,000 bits per second on a pin. 
Therefore, I conclude that it is likely that GPIO communication is only practical in terms of theoretical protocols, 
	and our cluster will always be faster using Ethernet. 
Moving forward, in terms of researching if it's possible for the cluster to compute more gigaflops than our current set-up, 
	I believe that experimenting with different designs of Etherent clusterings is our most promising solution.
