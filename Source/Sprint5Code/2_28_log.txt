Talked to Dr. Qiao last Friday. Taught us about routhing tables.

First off, every ODROID's ip address should be the same for the
first three values of the ip address.

Example:
192.168.0.xx
All ODROIDS must have that.

This was one of the errors we were having. We thought we could have
separate thrid values for each ODROID.

Example:
Dopey would be:
192.169.1.xx
xx would be each port of Dopey.

That doesn't work though.

Also, another theing we learned was that the mask should be:
255.255.255.255
This is because 255 is some large ass number of 1's for its binary value.
Masking is and-ing it with our ip address.
And-ing it with all 1's makes the values static and important.
And-ing with 0's makes them flexible.

Our mistake was using:
255.255.255.0
NO! NOT THE ZERO!!!

We also create each ethernet port.
eth0 eth1...

Gateway is a direct connection, MUST be on the other side of the line.
The gateway points to the next path on the ODROID.
It's similar to my 'roadmap.txt' file.
There needs to be a routing table (roadmap) on each ODROID. Each is unique.

Also, there may need to be internal forwarding.
Say a packet is sent to an ODROID, but it's not the destination.
It needs to be sent to the other ODROIDs port.
Psuedo code:
if( dest != recieving port )
{
    forward to other port.
}

Andrew got connection connection to the ODROIDs from one to the other 
	through another dwarf!
Updated the routing tables to what Qiao suggested. Then ran these commands 
	in the middle odroid.

>-A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth2 -j ACCEPT
>-A FORWARD -r eth2 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT
>sysct1 -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

I got the GPIO code to send 64 bytes of data
From Bashful to Sneezy pinging 64 bytes:
0.822 ms
0.834 ms
0.871 ms
0.910 ms
0.849 ms

Doing ./read Sneezy and ./write Bashful
send 1	1.081ms	NOT RECIEVED
send 3	1.065ms	Recieved
send 4	1.065ms	NOT RECIEVED
send 5	1.065ms Recieved
send 6	1.065ms	Recieved
send 7	1.068ms	NOT RECIEVED
send 8	1.065ms	Recieved
send 9	1.064ms	Recieved
send 10	1.117ms	Recieved
