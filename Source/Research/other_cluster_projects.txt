   Tennessee Oak Ridge Cluster Project (TORC)
       "  The research areas of the project include:
 	             Computing across mixed Unix and NT clusters
    		Combining clusters across administrative domains
    		Performance evaluation of multiple interconnects and protocols (VIA, FM,.)
    		Development of a cluster management tool suite
    		COTS cluster driven immersive devices -- cost effective CAVES
   	 	Testbed for evaluating heterogeneous clusters
    		Support research on NetSolve, Harness, Atlas, and Scalapack projects"

	VIA -  Virtual Interface Adapter - is a network protocol.  It is usually a network kind of interface but is usually a very high-performance, dedicated connection between two systems. Part of that high performance comes from specialized, dedicated hardware that knows that it has a dedicted connection and therefore doesn't have to deal with normal network addressing issues.

	FM -
	COTS -
	CAVES -
	NT cluster -
          
	There are several clusters both at UT and ORNL that are a part of the resources 
             available to the TORC project. Presently the largest is High TORC.
