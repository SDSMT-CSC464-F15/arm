This directory contains the necessary tools to build a debian package named
Linpack that has the high performance linpack executable built for ARM 
architecture. To create the package, the dependencies are
devscripts
debhelper
build-essential.

With those installed, run

./create

The filal .deb package will be in the linpackPackage directory.

Differences between the linpack code availible online and what is in the
contents of this directory are the debian subdirectory and all of it's 
contents, changes to the Makefile, and the addition of Makefile.armv7l.
