USB Communication:

Over 2.0, it is possible to use USB crossover cables to simulate Ethernet over
USB. The same technology is possible for USB 3.0, but no operating system
currently supports it, linux or otherwise. As such, direct communication
would have to be done in a different way than Ethernet, such as PyUSB. However,
I have not found a way to communicate from a host node to another host node by
using PyUSB.
