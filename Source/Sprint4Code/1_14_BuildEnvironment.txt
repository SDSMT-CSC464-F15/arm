Some quick notes on how I set up my build environment.
First, I created SSH keys on Red Queen with the command

ssh-keygen

and leaving all options as default by hitting enter through the prompts.


The first thing I used the keys for was to configure my Github account to
not make me enter my password every time I pushed to the repo. To do this,
I called

cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

and copied and pasted the public RSA key in to Github under the settings > 
SSH keys option. I then cloned the current repository with

git clone git@github.com:SDSMT-CSC464-F15/arm


The next thing I did was use the keys to be able to SSH to Snow_White without
being prompted for a password. I did this with

ssh-copy-id odroid@snow_white
	

Finally, I configured my SSH settings so I wouldn't have to type out
odroid@snow_white every time I needed to ssh over or use scp to move files.
I did this by created the file

.ssh/config

and putting in the contents

Host sw
	HostName snow_white
	User odroid

Now, I can SSH to the cluster with the command

ssh sw

or copy files from the repository with

scp [path to the file on Red Queen] sw:[path to where I want the file on Snow White]
