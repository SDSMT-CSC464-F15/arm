Trying to install wiringpi2 onto homedirectory, however it is not working.

Online sources says to update kernel.

>apt-get updrage linux-image-xu3
Got a purple screen (see image)
Ignore warning errors.

UPDATED!!!!

Testing it on Snow White.

Type gpio readall, shows pin mapping
Everything isn't in order. "Bah humbug" - Andrew

"Callup" - handles serial connection
"putty"
"tty"

Finally figured out the pin mapping for wiringpi. What a bitch a rudy doo

Having problems with switching to each device and hooking to internet via ethernet.
We had originally changed the fstab file so it would mount the home directory of Snow White automatically at start up.

The dwarfs complained. We are changing the fstab to their original glory. We already have a script to mount each.

Now we're updating the kernels of each droid.

>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist upgrade

disable fstab (comment out)
edit etc/interfaces, comment out code
reboot
connect to internet ethernet while rebooting
uname -a to check current kernel
sudo apt-get update, updates the repos
sudo apt-get upgrade linux-image-xu3
Sing the jepordy theme song
