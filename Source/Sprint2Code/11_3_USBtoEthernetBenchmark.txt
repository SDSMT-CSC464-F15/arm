The speed of the USB 3.0 to ethernet adapter, tested with iperf, 
	was notably slower than a direct ethernet connection. 
The tests varied greatly, between 300 mbps and 700 mbps. 
The USB ethernet adpated was faster acting as a server than a client, 
	with the highest value as a client being only about 475 mbps. 
In contrast, the ethernet connections were consistent regardless of 
	which device was the client or server, and stayed between 775 and 800 mbps.
Additionally, I have not found a way to connect two devices over USB-ethernet 
	to etherent directly. When attached to the switch, the devices and 
	communicate; however, if we were using the USB to ethernet adapters they 
	would be directly connected, without the switch. Therefore, being unable 
	to direct connect devices defeats the purpose of the adapters.
In conclusion, the drasically lower speed of the USB to etherent adpaters 
	and the inability to directly connect devices means that the devices are 
	very unlikely to useful for our purposes.
