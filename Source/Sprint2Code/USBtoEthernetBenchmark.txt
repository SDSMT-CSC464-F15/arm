The speed of the USB 3.0 to ethernet adapter, tested with iperf, was notably slower than a direct ethernet connection. The tests varied greatly, between 300 mbps and 700 mbps. The USB ethernet adpated was faster acting as a server than a client, with the highest value as a client being only about 475 mbps. In contrast, the ethernet connections were consistent regardless of which device was the client or server, and stayed between 775 and 800 mbps.
