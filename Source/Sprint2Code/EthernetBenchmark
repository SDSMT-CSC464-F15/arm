Ethernet speed of ODroid: 615-625 Mbps

Method: 

Create network between a machine with gigabit ethernet port and ODroid. On both the server machine and ODroid install iperf, a tool in the standard debian repositories to test network speed. Run iperf -s on the server machine, and iperf -c <IP of server machine> on the ODroid. The result was 615-625 Mbps.

Execute test:

This test can be run over the existing network by the following steps:

$ ssh andrewdesktop@208.107.223.45
	Password: design
$ iperf -s &
	Leave that running in the background.
$ ssh odroid@10.42.0.2
	Password: odroid
$ iperf -c 10.42.0.1
	This will take a few seconds to run, then give the network speed. The network 10.42.0.1 is over a 1000 Mbps wired connection between the ODroid and andrewdesktop.
