All eight ODroids are funtional. To test them, each device was connected to a router with internet access via ethernet, a monitor was connected through HDMI, and the mouse and keyboard were connected to both USB 3.0 ports to ensure they worked. Then the packages mpi-default-dev and openmpi-bin were installed and the test mpi code found in this directory was compiled and executed. No issues were found on any device.
