With two ODroid devices attached to the switch via direct ethernet 
	(no USB 3.0 to ethernet adapter), the connection speed was testing. 
	This was accomplished by one device running

iperf -s

and the other running

iperf -c [IP of the first device].

This method found the connection speed to be between 775 mbps and 800 mbps 
	in all tests. This is notably faster than the previous benchmark 
	between one ODroid and a non-ODroid machine not using a switch.
