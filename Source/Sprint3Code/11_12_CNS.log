We have been having an error on #3 and #4.

Andrew has mounted it. (See his log) but when we run it, it shows:
Buffer I/O error on device mmlskdfj, logical block 0

#2 has been working just fine. We are able to ping #3 and #4, but we can't ssh
into it.

When you boot #2, it shows the same error, but it actually boots (after a few moments)

Karlsson helped us. He told us to re-image the busted odroids. We can find 
the image on the site.

So that's what we are doing.
