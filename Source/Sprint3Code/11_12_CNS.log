We have been having an error on #3 and #4.

Andrew has mounted it. (See his log) but when we run it, it shows:
Buffer I/O error on device mmlskdfj, logical block 0

#2 has been working just fine. We are able to ping #3 and #4, but we can't ssh
into it.

When you boot #2, it shows the same error, 
but it actually boots (after a few moments)

Karlsson helped us. He told us to re-image the busted odroids. We can find 
the image on the site.

So that's what we are doing.

Downloaded image from online


OH WAIT!!!
ANDREW SOLVED IT!!! HE MISPELLED HOME!!!
So instead, we are taking each of the cards, going into the fstab file, 
and fixing our spelling mistakes
Never mind.....
He's going to take out the line that automatically mounts the home directory
Awww yea!! It works!! Sike, it reloaded.
Annnddddd it won't load at all...

#5 bypassesed the logical block error, but now it's stuck on some long-ass error. 

We're looking at /etc/exports


It wants it asychronous (?)
Karlsson moved the fstab -> fstab.back, and then he copied fstab~ to fstab so
now it loads console

Something in the boot sequence, trying to write something to a read only (?)

HALLALUUUJAAAHHAAA!!!!!!! WE GOT IT BACK!!
Changed fstab file to the original that it came with:
LABEL=boot		/media/boot		vfat		defaults 0	1
UUID=e139ce78-9841-40fe-8823-96a304a09859		/		ext4	defaults,noatime 	0		1

***********************
TO DO: Take down the passwords from the ODROIDS for when you ssh into them. 
MPI won't work with the passwords
ssh-keygen
Enter through it all
and thenssh-copy-id <ipaddress>

************************
To ssh via hostname, edit /etc/hosts
Add
<ipaddress> <hostname>



WOOO!!!!
