//Andrew, if you just want to clean this up and write the precise notes, that would be awesome

***Set IP Address***

-sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces

-This should be in there:
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# Include files from /etc/netword/interfaces.d
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.11 //or whatever you want the ip address to be
gateway 192.168.1.1

-ifconfig to confirm ip address

-Insert another odroid into switch

-Ping its ip address
ping <ipaddress>

-ssh into it

-iperf (Andrew knows more about this if you want to edit this)
iperf can time and ping the network
iperf -s //sets server odrooid
iperf -c <ip address> //sets client

***set up network***
sudo ifdown eth0
sudo ifup eth0

test pinging to another odroid and then ssh-ing

Share home drive

Hooked Snow White to internet
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

Hmmm, not working. The odroid is not connected to the internet.
Tried commenting out our interfaces
Reboot
Connected!

apt-get again
/etc/eports

Installed nfs-kernel-server onto Snow White
Trouble mounting
Now we need to install a client onto the others

This involves connecting internet to the other odroids...UGHGHGHGHGH

On client
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs <ipsnowwhite>:/home /home
