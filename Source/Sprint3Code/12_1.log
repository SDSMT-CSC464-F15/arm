Replaced Sleepy and Sneezy with new ODROIDS. Everything is now working.

We're being anal about these so we don't need to replace any new ones. 
We've been shutting them down manually by ssh-ing into each and doing
-sudo shutdown now
We have an idea to write script to shutdown all the odroids

We also have an idea to write a script to mount the home directory to all
of the odroids
However, we're not sure how to get past the sudo password
We're looking at the file
/etc/sudoers

Wrote code to mount. However, you have to type password and accept esa 
fingerprint(?), but it's faster than typing out command every time

MPI code mpi_text works on everything!!!

Copied the mount code to kill the dwarfs. It works, still have to type
the password for all of them however.
