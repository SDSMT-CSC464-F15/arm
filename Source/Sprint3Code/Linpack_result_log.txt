	Running linpack using all 8 cores on all 8 devices: 7.701e-04    (last test used as a reference point) 
	 Slower than expected
	
	Running linpack using all 8 cores on only Snow White: 6.444e-02   (last test used as a reference point)
	 Faster than using all 8 cores on all 8 devices
	 
	Running linpack using 4 cores on Snow White: 6.500e-02            (last test used as a reference point)
	 Essentially the same as using all 8 cores on Snow White
	 
	Running  linpack using 1 core from the first 4 devices: 7.434e-04 (last test used as a reference point)
	 Little, if any, change from running all 8 cores on all 8 devices
