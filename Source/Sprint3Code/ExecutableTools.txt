In order to use the tools we created easily, they have been formatted as 
executable commands by adding #!/bin/bash or #!/bin/usr/python and calling
chmod +x <file name> on them. This will allow us to put them in /usr/bin and
call them from any directory to easily mount all the dwarfs, shutdown all the
dwarfs, change and reboot the network to use the internet or go back on to the
switch, or execute linpack. While not a drastic change, this should prove to
make our lives a little easier.
