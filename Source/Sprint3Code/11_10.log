Odroid #2 was being troublesome. I hooked up #1 and #2 to the network. From #1 I tried pinging #2 and ssh-ing. It wasn't happening.
I switched #2 with #3 and it worked fine.
When I hooked up just #2 to the screen, nothing was coming up. I had to unplug-plug and then the fans started going and it was working again.

I'm trying to connect to the internet so I can install vim because vi is a bitch.
Found this:
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

To change hostname
sudo vi /etc/hostname
Overwrite "odroid" with new hostname
Reboot
You're golden
...or not.
#2 isn't ping-ing to Snow_White, but Snow_White will ping to odroid

I found /etc/hosts
it has 127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.0.1   odroid

I'm going to change odroid to its new name

In /etc/nsswitch.conf, I'm changing 
hosts:  files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
to
hosts: files dns

Have to leave. It's still not working.
