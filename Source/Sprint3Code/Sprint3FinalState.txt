Overview of the state of the cluster as of sprint 3 conclusion.

Hardware:
  - Eight functioning odroids, two non functioning.
  - One switch.
  - Power supply with nine power cables.
  - Eight one gigabit ethernet cables.
  - All securely mounted on an acrylic board. 

Configuration:
  - All odroids are on the same network, connected over the switch (192.169.1.x)
  - All odroids are named, and able to recognize the IP address of the names of
    the others (i.e. any command that needs an IP can be executed with the name
    instead, such as ping dopey or ssh happy)
  - Snow White can SSH into any dwarf without a password, and vise versa.
  - Any dwarf can execute sudo without needed a password input.
  - The /home directory of Snow White is an NFS share that the dwarfs can mount.

Software:
  - Linpack and ATLAS are built on Snow White, in the home directory.
  - MPI is installed and working on all eight devices.
  - Four tools exist in Snow White in the /usr/bin directory:
      mountHomeDir - mounts the /home directory of all seven dwarfs to the /home
        directory of Snow White.
      killDwarfs - shuts down the seven dwarfs.
      changeNetwork - changes the network configuration to allow the device to
        connect to the interent instead of the local network, or vise vera.
      linpack - executes linpack on a given number of processes. 

Knowledge:
  - Speed of Etherent switch: ~750 Mbps
  - Maximum gigaflops possible: ~3e-4

Set backs:
  - Two odroids burned, they have been replaced.
  - Editing /etc/fstab to automatically mount the home directory of Snow White
    on the dwarfs proved unsuccessful. This is something the team will continue
    to persue in future sprints.
