How to change Host Name:

In /etc/hostname:
Overwrite "odroid" with new hostname

In /etc/hosts, it has 127.0.0.1    
-localhost
-127.0.0.1   odroid
changed the later to the new hostname

In /etc/nsswitch.conf, I'm changing 
-hosts:  files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
to
-hosts: files dns

-cns
