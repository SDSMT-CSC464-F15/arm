Docmentation To Do:

-* Must do
- Maybe
(?) Do we need it?

-Elevator Pitch could be extended
-User stories need to be looked over
-Terminology and Acronyms-I've been adding more as I've been working
	on this.
-Software contract: straighten out. I might still have it to rescan. -cns
-Sprint reports: sprint 1, add overview, same with sprint 4 and 5
-Take out the automatic tabs in some paragraphs
-Add LINPACK stuff to the log
-Make tables for some of the values in the log section
-Some sort of spiel in the Publications about what the following
	documents are.
-Reference the images in some locations. I commented where they would be
	needed in log.tex and userdocs.tex. I'm not sure how necessary it
	is though.
